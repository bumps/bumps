The original version of this software, called LMFIT, was written in FORTRAN
as part of the MINPACK-1 package by XXX.

Craig Markwardt converted the FORTRAN code to IDL.  The information for the
IDL version is:

     UPDATED VERSIONs can be found on my WEB PAGE:
        http://cow.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/idl.html

Mark Rivers created this Python version from Craig's IDL version.
