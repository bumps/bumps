Defining a film
===============

We start with a basic example, a nickel film on silicon:

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import plot_model
   plot_model('nifilm.py')

This model shows three layers (silicon, nickel, and air) as seen in the
solid green line (the step profile).  In addition we have a dashed green
line (the smoothed profile) which corresponds the effective reflectivity
profile, with the $\exp(-2 k_n k_{n+1} \sigma^2)$ interface factored in.

This model is defined in :download:`nifilm.py <nifilm.py>`.

You can preview the model on the command line::

  $ refl1d nifilm.py --preview

Lets examine the code down on a line by line basis to understand what is
going on.

The first step in any model is to load the names of the functions and
data that we are going to use.  These are defined in a module named
refl1d.names, and we import them all as follows::

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  
This statement imports functions like SLD and Material for defining
materials, Parameter, Slab and Stack for defining materials,
NeutronProbe and XrayProbe for defining data, and Experiment and
FitProblem to tie everything together.

Note that 'import \*' is bad style for anything but simple scripts.  As
programs get larger, it is much less confusing to list the specific
functions that you need from a module rather than importing everything.

Next we define the materials that we are going to use in our sample.
silicon and air are common, so we don't need to define them.  We just
need to define nickel, which we do as follows::

::

  nickel = Material('Ni')
  
This defines a chemical formula, Ni, for which the program knows the
density in advance since it has densities for all elements.  By using
chemical composition, we can compute scattering length densities for
both X-ray and neutron beams from the same sample description.
Alternatively, we could take a more traditional approach and define
nickel as a specific SLD for our beam

::

  #nickel = SLD(rho=9.4)
  
The '#' character on the above line means that line is a comment, and
it won't be evaluated.

With our materials defined (silicon, nickel and air), we can combine
them into a sample. The substrate will be silicon with a 5 |Ang|
1-\ $\sigma$ Si:Ni interface.  The nickel layer is 100 |Ang| thick
with a 5 |Ang| Ni:Air interface.  Air is on the surface.

::

  sample = silicon(0,5) | nickel(100,5) | air
  
Our sample definition is complete, so now we need to specify the
range of values we are going to view.  We will use the
`numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ library, which extends python
with vector and matrix operations.  The `linspace` function below
returns values from 0 to 5 in 100 steps for incident angles
from 0\ |deg| to 5\ |deg|.

::

  T = numpy.linspace(0, 5, 100)
  
From the range of reflection angles, we can create a neutron probe. The probe
defines the wavelengths and angles which are used for the measurement as well
as their uncertainties.  From this the resolution of each point can be
calculated.  We use constants for angular divergence ``dT=0.01``\ |deg|,
wavelength ``L=4.75`` |Ang| and wavelength dispersion ``dL=0.0475`` in this
example, but each angle and wavelength is independent.

::

  probe = NeutronProbe(T=T, dT=0.01, L=4.75, dL=0.0475)
  
Combine the neutron probe with the sample stack to define an
experiment.  Using chemical formula and mass density, the same
sample can be simulated for both neutron and x-ray experiments.

::

  M = Experiment(probe=probe, sample=sample)
  
Generate a random data set with 5% noise. While not necessary
to display a reflectivity curve, it is useful in showing how
the data set should look.

::

  M.simulate_data(5)
  
Combine a set of experiments into a fitting problem.  The problem
is used by refl1d for all operations on the model.

::

  problem = FitProblem(M)
