Attaching data
==============

Simulating data is great for seeing how models might look when measured
by a reflectometer, but mostly we are going to use the program to fit
measured data.  We saved the simulated data from above into files named
:download:`nifilm-tof-1.dat`, :download:`nifilm-tof-2.dat`,
:download:`nifilm-tof-3.dat` and :download:`nifilm-tof-4.dat`.
We can load these datasets into a new model using
:download:`nifilm-data.py <nifilm-data.py>`.

The sample and instrument definition is the same as before:

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  
  nickel = Material('Ni')
  sample = silicon(0,5) | nickel(100,5) | air
  
  instrument = SNS.Liquids()
  
In this case we are loading multiple data sets into the same
:class:`ProbeSet <refl1d.probe.ProbeSet>` object.  If your
reduction program stitches together the data for you, then you can simply
use ``probe=instrument.load('file')``.

::

  files = ['nifilm-tof-%d.dat'%d for d in 1,2,3,4]
  probe = ProbeSet(instrument.load(f) for f in files)
  
The data and sample are combined into an
:class:`Experiment <refl1d.experiment.Experiment>`,
which again is bundled as a
:class:`FitProblem <refl1d.fitter.FitProblem>`
for the fitting program.

::

  M = Experiment(probe=probe, sample=sample)
  
  problem = FitProblem(M)
  
  
The plot remains the same:

.. plot::

    from sitedoc import plot_model
    plot_model('nifilm-data.py')
