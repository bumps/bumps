Choosing an instrument
======================

Let's modify the simulation to show how a 100 |Ang| nickel film might
look if measured on the SNS Liquids reflectometer:

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import plot_model
   plot_model('nifilm-tof.py')

This model is defined in :download:`nifilm-tof.py <nifilm-tof.py>`

The sample definition is the same:

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  
  nickel = Material('Ni')
  sample = silicon(0,5) | nickel(100,5) | air
  
Instead of using a generic probe, we are using an instrument definition
to control the simulation.

::

  instrument = SNS.Liquids()
  M = instrument.simulate(sample,
                          T=[0.3,0.7,1.5,3],
                          slits=[0.06, 0.14, 0.3, 0.6],
                          uncertainty = 5,
                          )
  
The *instrument* line tells us to use the geometry of the SNS Liquids
reflectometer, which includes information like the distance between the
sample and the slits and the wavelength range.  We then simulate measurements
of the sample for several different angles *T* (degrees), each with its
own slit opening *slits* (mm).  The simulated measurement duration is
such that the median relative error on the measurement $\Delta R/R$
will match *uncertainty* (%).  Because the intensity $I(\lambda)$ varies
so much for a time-of-flight measurement, the central points will be
measured with much better precision, and the end points will be measured
with lower precision.  See
:meth:`Pulsed.simulate <refl1d.instrument.Pulsed.simulate>` for details
on all simulation parameters.

Finally, we bundle the simulated measurement as a fit problem which
is used by the rest of the program.

::

  problem = FitProblem(M)
