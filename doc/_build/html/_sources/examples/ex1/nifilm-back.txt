Back reflectivity
=================

For samples measured with the incident beam through the substrate rather
than reflecting off the surface, we don't need to modify our sample, we
just need to tell the experiment that we are measuring back reflectivity.

We set up the example as before.

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  
  nickel = Material('Ni')
  sample = silicon(0,25) | nickel(100,5) | air
  T = numpy.linspace(0, 5, 100)
  
Because we are measuring back reflectivity, we create a probe which has
back_reflectivity = True.

::

  probe = NeutronProbe(T=T, dT=0.01, L=4.75, dL=0.0475, back_reflectivity=True)
  
The remainder of the model definition is unchanged.

::

  M = Experiment(probe=probe, sample=sample)
  M.simulate_data(5)
  problem = FitProblem(M)
