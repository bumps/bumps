Performing a fit
================

Now that we know how to define a sample and load data, we can learn how
to perform a fit on the data.  This is shown in
:download:`nifilm-fit.py <nifilm-fit.py>`:

We use the usual sample definition, except we set the thickness of the
nickel layer to 125 |Ang| so that the model does not match the data:

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  
  nickel = Material('Ni')
  sample = silicon(0,10) | nickel(125,10) | air
  
We are going to try to recover the original thickness by letting the
thickness value range by $125 \pm 50$ |Ang|.  Since nickel is layer 1 in
the sample (counting starts at 0 in Python), we can access the layer
parameters using sample[1].  The parameter we are accessing is the
thickness parameter, and we are setting it's fit range to $\pm 50$ |Ang|.

::

  sample[1].thickness.pm(50)
  
We are also going to let the interfacial roughness between the layers vary.
The interface between two layers is defined by the width of the interface on
top of the layer below.  Here we are restricting the silicon:nickel interface
to the interval $[3,12]$ and the nickel:air interface to the range $[0,20]$:

::

  sample[0].interface.range(3,12)
  sample[1].interface.range(0,20)
  
The data is loaded as before.

::

  instrument = SNS.Liquids()
  files = ['nifilm-tof-%d.dat'%d for d in 1,2,3,4]
  probe = ProbeSet(instrument.load(f) for f in files)
  
  M = Experiment(probe=probe, sample=sample)
  
  problem = FitProblem(M)
  
As you can see the new nickel thickness changes the theory curve
significantly:

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import plot_model
   plot_model('nifilm-fit.py')

We can now load and run the fit::

  # refl1d nifilm-fit.py --fit=newton --steps=100 --store=T1

The ``--fit=newton`` option says to use the quasi-newton optimizer for
not more than 100 steps.  The ``--store=T1`` option says to store the
initial model, the fit results and any monitoring information in the
directory T1.

Here is the resulting fit:

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import fit_model
   fit_model('nifilm-fit.py')

All is well: $\chi^2$ will be approximately 1 and the line goes nicely
through the data.
