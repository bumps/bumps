Hard material structures
=========================

Here is an example of a multilayer system in the literature:

   Singh, S., Basu, S., Bhatt, P., Poswal, A.K.,
   Phys. Rev. B, 79, 195435 (2009)

In this paper, the authors are interested in the interdiffusion properties
of Ni into Ti through x-ray and neutron reflectivity measurements. The
question of alloying at metal-metal interfaces at elevated temperatures is
critically important for device fabrication and reliability.

The model is defined in :download:`NiTi.py <NiTi.py>`.

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import plot_model
   plot_model('NiTi-web.py')


First define the materials we will use

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  
  nickel = Material('Ni')
  titanium = Material('Ti')
  
Next we will compose nickel and titanium into a bilayer and use that
bilayer to define a stack with 10 repeats.

::

  # Superlattice description
  bilayer = nickel(50,5) | titanium(50,5)
  sample = silicon(0,5) | bilayer*10 | air
  
We allow the thickness to vary by +/- 100%

::

  # Fitting parameters
  bilayer[0].thickness.pmp(100)
  bilayer[1].thickness.pmp(100)
  
The interfaces vary between 0 and 30 |Ang|. The interface between repeats is
defined by the interface at the top of the repeating stack, which in this case
is the Ti interface.  The interface between the superlattice and the next
layer is an independent parameter, whose value defaults to the same initial
value as the interface between the repeats.

::

  bilayer[0].interface.range(0,30)
  bilayer[1].interface.range(0,30)
  sample[0].interface.range(0,30)
  sample[1].interface.range(0,30)
  
If we wanted to have the interface for Ti between repeats identical to
the interface between Ti and air, we could have tied the parameters
together, but we won't in this example::

  # sample[1].interface = bilayer[1].interface



If instead we wanted to keep the roughness independent, but start with
a different initial value, we could simply set the interface parameter
value.  In this case, we are setting it to 10 |Ang|\ ::

  # sample[1].interface.value = 10

We can also fit the number of repeats.  This is not realistic in this
example (the sample grower surely knows the number of layers in a
sample like this), so we do so only to demonstrate how it works.

::

  sample[1].repeat.range(5,15)
  
Before we can view the reflectivity, we must define the Q range over
which we want to simulate, and combine this probe with the sample.

::

  T = numpy.linspace(0, 5, 100)
  probe = XrayProbe(T=T, dT=0.01, L=4.75, dL=0.0475)
  M = Experiment(probe=probe, sample=sample)
  M.simulate_data(5)
  problem = FitProblem(M)
