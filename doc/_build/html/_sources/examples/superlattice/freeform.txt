Freeform structures
===================

The following is a freeform superlattice floating in a solvent
and anchored with a tether molecule.  The tether is anchored via
a thiol group to a multilayer of Si/Cr/Au.  The sulphur in the
thiol attaches well to gold, but not silicon.  Gold will stick
to chrome which sticks to silicon.

Here is the plot using a random tether, membrane and tail group:

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import plot_model
   plot_model('freeform.py')

The model is defined by :download:`freeform.py <freeform.py>`.

The materials are straight forward:

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  
  chrome = Material('Cr')
  gold = Material('Au')
  solvent = Material('H2O', density=1)
  
  
The sample description is more complicated.  When we define a freeform
layer we need to anchor the ends of the freeform layer to a known
material.  Usually, this is just the material that makes up the preceding
and following layer.  In case we have freeform layers connected to each
other, though, we need an anchor material that controls the SLD at the
connection point.  For this purpose we introduce the dummy material
wrap

::

  wrap = SLD(name="wrap", rho=0)
  
Each section of the freeform layer has a different number of control
points.  The value should be large enough to give the profile enough
flexibility to match the data, but not so large that it over fits the
data.  Roughly the number of control points is the number of peaks and
valleys allowed.  We want a relatively smooth tether and tail, so we
keep *n1* and *n3* small, but make *n2* large enough to define an
interesting repeat structure.

::

  n1, n2, n3 = 3,9,3
  
Free layers have a thickness, horizontal control points *z* varying
in $[0,1]$, real and complex SLD $\rho$ and $\rho_i$, and the material
above and below.

::

  tether = FreeLayer(below=gold, above=wrap, thickness=10,
                     z=numpy.linspace(0,1,n1+2)[1:-1],
                     rho=numpy.random.rand(n1),name="tether")
  bilayer = FreeLayer(below=wrap, above=wrap, thickness=80,
                      z=numpy.linspace(0,1,n2+2)[1:-1],
                      rho=5*numpy.random.rand(n2)-1,name="bilayer")
  tail = FreeLayer(below=wrap, above=solvent, thickness=10,
                     z=numpy.linspace(0,1,n3+2)[1:-1],
                     rho=numpy.random.rand(n3),name="tail")
  
With the predefined free layers, we can quickly define a stack, with
the bilayer repeat structure.  Note that we are setting the thickness
for the free layers when we define the layers, so there is no need to
set it when composing the layers into a sample.

::

  sample = (silicon(0,5) | chrome(20,2) | gold(50,5)
            | tether | bilayer*10 | tail | solvent)
  
Finally, simulate the resulting model.

::

  T = numpy.linspace(0, 5, 100)
  probe = NeutronProbe(T=T, dT=0.01, L=4.75, dL=0.0475,
                       back_reflectivity=True)
  M = Experiment(probe=probe, sample=sample, dA=5)
  M.simulate_data(5)
  problem = FitProblem(M)
