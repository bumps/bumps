Channel measurement
===================

In this example we will look at a nickel grating on a silicon substrate
using specular reflectivity. When the spacing within the grating is
sufficiently large, this can be modeled to first order as the incoherent sum
of the reflectivity on the plateau and the reflectivity on the valley floor.
By adjusting the weight of two reflectivities, we should be able to
determine the ratio of plateau width to valley width.

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import plot_model
   plot_model('mixed.py')

Since silicon and air are defined, the only material we need to
define is nickel.

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  nickel = Material('Ni')
  
We need two separate models, one with 1000 |Ang| nickel and one without.

::

  plateau = silicon(0,5) | nickel(1000,200) | air
  valley = silicon(0,5) | air
  
We need only one probe for simulation.  The reflectivity measured at
the detector will be a mixture of those neutrons which reflect off
the plateau and those that reflect off the valley.

::

  T = numpy.linspace(0, 2, 200)
  probe = NeutronProbe(T=T, dT=0.01, L=4.75, dL=0.0475)
  
We are going to start with a 1:1 ratio of plateau to valley and create
a simulated data set.

::

  M = MixedExperiment(samples=[plateau,valley], probe=probe, ratio=[1,1])
  M.simulate_data(5)
  
We will assume the silicon interface is the same for the valley as the
plateau, which depending on the how the sample is constructed, may or
may not be realistic.

::

  valley[0].interface = plateau[0].interface
  
We will want to fit the thicknesses and interfaces as usual.

::

  plateau[0].interface.range(0,200)
  plateau[1].interface.range(0,200)
  plateau[1].thickness.range(200,1800)
  
The ratio between the valley and the plateau can also be fit, either
by fixing size of the plateau and fitting the size of the valley or
fixing the size of the valley and fitting the size of the plateau.  We
will hold the plateau fixed.

::

  M.ratio[1].range(0,5)
  
Note that we could include a second order effect by including a
hillside term with the same height as the plateau but using a
50:50 mixture of air and nickel.  In this case we would have three
entries in the ratio.

We wrap this as a fit problem as usual.

::

  problem = FitProblem(M)
  
This complete model script is defined in

We can test how well the fitter can recover the original model
by running refl1d with --random::

   $ refl1d mixed.py --random --store=T1
