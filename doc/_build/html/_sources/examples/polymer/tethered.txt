Defining the film
=================

We first need to define the materials

::

  from refl1d.names import *
  from copy import copy
  
  # === Materials ===
  SiOx = SLD(name="SiOx",rho=3.47)
  D_toluene = SLD(name="D-toluene",rho=5.66)
  D_initiator = SLD(name="D-initiator",rho=1.5)
  D_polystyrene = SLD(name="D-PS",rho=6.2)
  H_toluene = SLD(name="H-toluene",rho=0.94)
  H_initiator = SLD(name="H-initiator",rho=0)
  
In this case we are using the neutron scattering length density as is
standard practice in reflectivity experiments rather than the chemical
formula and mass density.  The :class:`SLD <refl1d.material.SLD>` class
allows us to name the material and define the real and imaginary components
of scattering length density $\rho$.  Note that we are using the imaginary
$\rho_i$ rather than the absorption coefficient $\mu = 2\lambda\rho_i$
since it removes the dependence on wavelength from the calculation of
the reflectivity.

For the tethered polymer we don't use a simple slab model, but instead
define a :class:`PolymerBrush <refl1d.polymer.PolymerBrush>`
layer, which understands that the system is compose of polymer plus
solvent, and that the polymer chains tail off like:

.. math::

   V(z) = \left\{
          \begin{array}{ll}
           V_o                        & \mbox{if } z <= z_o \\
           V_o (1 - ((z-z_o)/L)^2)^p  & \mbox{if } z_o < z < z_o + L \\
           0                          & \mbox{if } z >= z_o + L
           \end{array}
          \right.

This volume profile combines with the scattering length density of the
polymer and the solvent to form an SLD profile:

.. math::

    \rho(z) = \rho_p V(z) + \rho_s (1 - V(z))

The tethered polymer layer definition looks like



::

  # === Sample ===
  # Deuterated sample
  D_brush = PolymerBrush(polymer=D_polystyrene, solvent=D_toluene,
                         base_vf=70, base=120, length=80, power=2,
                         sigma=10)
  
This layer can be combined with the remaining layers to form the
deuterated measurement sample

::

  D = (silicon(0,5) | SiOx(100,5) | D_initiator(100,20) | D_brush(400,0)
       | D_toluene)
  
The stack notation ``material(thickness, interface) | ...`` is performing
a number of tasks for you.  One thing it is doing is wrapping materials
(which are objects that understand scattering length densities) into
slabs (which are objects that understand thickness and interface).  These
slabs are then gathered together into a stack::

   L_silicon = Slab(material=silicon, thickness=0, interface=5)
   L_SiOx = Slab(material=SiOx, thickness=100, interface=5)
   L_D_initiator = Slab(material=D_initiator, thickness=100, interface=20)
   L_D_brush = copy(D_brush)
   L_D_brush.thickness = Parameter.default(400,name=D_brush.name+" thickness")
   L_D_brush.interface = Parameter.default(0,name=D_brush.name+" interface")
   L_D_toluene = Slab(material=D_toluene)
   D = Stack([L_silicon, L_SiOx, L_D_initiator, L_D_brush, L_D_toluene])

The undeuterated sample is similar to the deuterated sample. We start
by copying the polymer brush layer so that parameters such as *length*,
*power*, etc. will be shared between the two systems, but we replace the
deuterated toluene solvent with undeuterated toluene.  We then use
this *H_brush* to define a new stack with undeuterated tolune


::

  # Undeuterated sample is a copy of the deuterated sample
  H_brush = copy(D_brush)       # Share tethered polymer parameters...
  H_brush.solvent = H_toluene   # ... but use different solvent
  H = silicon | SiOx | H_initiator | H_brush | H_toluene
  
We want to share thickness and interface between the two systems
as well, so we write a loop to go through the layers of *D* and
copy the thickness and interface parameters to *H*

::

  for i,_ in enumerate(D):
      H[i].thickness = D[i].thickness
      H[i].interface = D[i].interface
  
What is happening internally is that for each layer in the stack we are
copying the parameter for the thickness from the deuterated sample
slab to the thickness slot in the undeuterated sample slab.  Similarly
for interface.  When the refinement engine sets a new value for a
thickness parameter and asks the two models to evaluate $\chi^2$, both
models will see the same thickness parameter value.

Setting fit ranges
==================

With both samples defined, we next specify the ranges on the fitted
parameters

::

  # === Fit parameters ===
  for i in 0, 1, 2:
      D[i].interface.range(0,100)
  D[1].thickness.range(0,200)
  D[2].thickness.range(0,200)
  D_polystyrene.rho.range(6.2,6.5)
  SiOx.rho.range(2.07,4.16) # Si to SiO2
  D_toluene.rho.pmp(5)
  D_initiator.rho.range(0,1.5)
  D_brush.base_vf.range(50,80)
  D_brush.base.range(0,200)
  D_brush.length.range(0,500)
  D_brush.power.range(0,5)
  D_brush.sigma.range(0,20)
  
  # Undeuterated system adds two extra parameters
  H_toluene.rho.pmp(5)
  H_initiator.rho.range(-0.5,0.5)
  
Notice that in some cases we are using layer number to reference the
parameter, such as ``D[1].thickness`` whereas in other cases we are using
variables directly, such as ``D_toluene.rho``.  Determining which to
use requires an understanding of the underlying stack model.  In this
case, the thickness is associated with the SiOx slab thickness, but
we never formed a variable to contain ``Slab(material=SiOx)``, so we
have to reference it via the stack.   We did however create a variable
to contain ``Material(name="D_toluene")`` so we can access its parameters
directly.  Also, notice that we only need to set one of ``D[1].thickness``
and ``H[1].thickness`` since they are the same underlying parameter.


Attaching data
==================

Next we associate the reflectivity curves with the samples:

::

  # === Data files ===
  instrument = NCNR.NG7(Qlo=0.005, slits_at_Qlo=0.075)
  D_probe = instrument.load('10ndt001.refl', back_reflectivity=True)
  H_probe = instrument.load('10nht001.refl', back_reflectivity=True)
  
We set ``back_reflectivity=True`` because we are coming in through the
substrate.  The reflectometry calculator will automatically reverse
the stack and adjust the effective incident angle to account for the
refraction when the beam enters the side of the substrate.  Ideally
you will have measured the incident beam intensity through the substrate
as well so that substrate absorption effects are corrected for in your
data reduction steps, but if not, you can set an estimate for
``back_absorption`` when you load the file.  Like ``intensity`` you can
set a range on the value and adjust it during refinement.

Finally, we define the fitting problem from the probes and samples.
The dz parameter controls the size of the profiles steps when generating
the tethered polymer interface.  The dA parameter allows these steps
to be joined together into larger slabs, with each slab having
$(\rho_{\text max} - \rho_{\text min}) w < \Delta A$.

::

  # === Problem definition ===
  D_model = Experiment(sample=D, probe=D_probe, dz=0.5, dA=1)
  H_model = Experiment(sample=H, probe=H_probe, dz=0.5, dA=1)
  models = H_model, D_model
  
This is a multifit problem where both models contribute to the goodness
of fit measure $\chi^2$.  Since no weight vector was defined the fits
have equal weight.

::

  problem = MultiFitProblem(models=models)
  problem.name = "tethered"
  
The polymer brush model is a smooth profile function, which is evaluated
by slicing it into thin slabs, then joining together similar slabs to
improve evaluation time.  The ``dz=0.5`` parameter tells us that we
should slice the brush into 0.5 |Ang| steps.  The ``dA=1`` parameter
says we should join together thin slabs while the scattering density
uncertainty in the joined slabs $\Delta A < 1$, where
$\Delta A = (\max\rho - \min\rho)(\max z - \min z)$.  Similarly for
the absorption cross section $\rho_i$ and the effective magnetic cross
section $\rho_M \cos(\theta_M)$.  If ``dA=None`` (the default) then no
profile contraction occurs.

The resulting model looks like:

.. plot::

   from sitedoc import plot_model
   plot_model('tethered.py')

This complete model script is defined in
:download:`tethered.py <tethered.py>`:

.. literalinclude:: tethered.py

The model can be fit using the parallel tempering optimizer::

   $ refl1d tethered.py --fit=pt --store=T1
