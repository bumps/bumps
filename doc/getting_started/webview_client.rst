Webview client
==============

The webview client is a web application that runs in the browser and communicates with the server to perform
model editing, data visualization, and fitting operations. The client is built using modern web technologies
such as TypeScript, Vue.js, and Plotly, and is included (pre-compiled) with the python wheel for
pip installs and also in the binary installers.
