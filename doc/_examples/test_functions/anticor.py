"""
Example model with strong correlations between the fitted parameters.

We use a*x = y + N(0,1) made complicated by defining a=p1+p2.

The expected distribution for p1 and p2 will be uniform, with p2 = a-p1 in
each sample.  Because this distribution is inherently unbounded, artificial
bounds are required on a least one of the parameters for finite duration
simulations.

The expected distribution for p1+p2 can be determined from the linear model
y = a*x.  This is reported along with the values estimated from MCMC.
