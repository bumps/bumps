# Check the entropy calculator
# ============================
#
# A single measure for a multivariate distribution is the entropy
#
# .. math:
#    E = - \int_\Omega \log(p(x)) p(x)\,\text{d}x
#
# By comparing the entropy of the prior distribution (usually a box uniform
# distribution with entropy $\sum_{i=1}^n \log(w_i)$ where $w_i$ is the
# range on parameter $i$ and $n$ is the number of paramters, but maybe
# lower if explicit priors are given for any of the parameters based on
# information from other sources) to the entropy computed from the posterior,
# you can estimate the number of bits of information from the fit to the data.
#
# Note that bumps calculates the entropy expected from the closest multivariate
# normal distribution (MVN) as well as directly from the samples.  The sample
# derived entropy has more variability, particularly in high dimensions.
#
# Many of the probability distributions in scipy.stats include a method
# to compute the entropy of the distribution.  We can use these to test
# the values from bumps against known good values.

# the other distributions, the estimated entropy is within uncertainty of
# actual value, but the uncertainty is a bit high.

# The other fitters, which use the curvature at the peak to estimate
# the entropy, do not work reliably when the fit is not normal.  Try
# the same distributions with *--fit=amoeba* to see this.
