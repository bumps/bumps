/**
@page TestsREADME Tests and Benchmarks

The tests/ directory contains tests and timing
harnesses for the components of the Random123 library.

<b>See @ref ExamplesREADME "../examples" for examples</b> of how to
use the Random123 APIs in different contexts.

The code in this directory (tests/) is not exemplary because it
sacrifices readability to support many different generators (philox,
threefry, ARS), programming models (C, C++, CUDA, OpenCL, Metal),
compilers (gcc, clang, icc), hardware (Intel, ARM, NVidia), and
operating systems (Linux, Windows, OSX).

@section building Compiling and Running the code

Installing and using Random123 requires only the use
of the header files, and  has no prerequisites other than
a reasonable C99 or C++98 compiler.

With a modern GNU make (3.80 or newer), building and running the core tests
and examples can be as easy as running gmake with no arguments.
Note, though, that the provided tests/GNUmakefile intentionally avoids setting
any of the standard make variables:  CC, CXX, CPPFLAGS, CFLAGS,
CXXFLAGS, TARGET_ARCH, LDFLAGS,  LOADLIBES, LDLIBS.  GNU make
will inherit settings for these variables from the environment,
or they may be set on the command line.  If none  are set,
compilation will proceed using system-wide default flags, generally
without advanced optimization, architectural tuning, warnings, or other
common options.  

Before putting the Random123 library to use in an application,
it is important to test it using the same compiler flags and
features that the application will use.  In other words,
the conventional make variables should be set
the same way when testing the library as they will be set when the
library is actually compiled into your application.
Something like:
@code
gmake CFLAGS="-std=c99" CXXFLAGS="-std=c++0x" CPPFLAGS="/alternate/location/include -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-aliasing=2" TARGET_ARCH="-march=native"
@endcode
would confirm that all is well with optimization on, and output targeted at
an architecture with the same capabilities as the machine running the compilation.

Very old versions of GNU make (pre-2002) or non-GNU
make will not work with tests/GNUmakefile.. Lacking a suitably modern GNU make,
our advice is to invoke the
C or C++ compiler directly on the source files in the tests/ directory.
The file tests/BUILD.LOG contains a list of sample build commands.  They
will almost certainly need to be adapted to the target system.
For Windows users, BUILDVC.BAT invokes the Microsoft
Visual Studio compiler.  Edit it as needed for your platform.


@section tests Tests

It is recommended that Random123 be tested <b> on the target system,
with the target compiler, intended optimization levels, options,
target architectures, etc.</b>
before relying it.  The library
uses architecture- and compiler-specific intrinsics,
features and assembly language.  We have seen  cases where
one compiler (open64 version 4.2.4) masquerades as another compiler (it defines __GNUC__) accepts extensions
specific to the other compiler (__uint128_t)
without error or warning, and then silently produces incorrect code.
The only way to guard against this kind of misbehavior is to
compile and run the tests with the compiler and options that you intend to use and
the platform that you intend to run on.

@subsection kat Known Answer Tests

Testing that your compiled code computes the same "Known Answers" as the
reference implementation which has been subjected to the Crush batteries of
statistical tests is critically important.

The file \c tests/kat_vectors contains a few dozen "Known Answer
Test" vectors, i.e., tuples of (method, counter, key, answer).  The
source file katc.c is incorporated into kat_c.c (C),
kat_cpp.cpp (C++), kat_cuda.cu (CUDA) and kat_opencl.c
(OpenCL), which are compiled into kat_c, kat_cpp, kat_cuda
and kat_opencl, respectively.  Each of these will read kat_vectors
and verify that the compiled code obtains the same "known answers".

The kat vectors are not language-specific.  Implementations of CBRNGs in
other languages could also be validated against \c kat_vectors.  The
kat vectors are also byte-order independent.  In other
words, the CBRNGs in the library should produce the same numerical
results on little-endian and big-endian hardware, but this behavior
is largely untested.

@subsection ut Unit Tests

tests/ also contains tests of specific components of the library.  While not
exhaustive, these tests verify that a variety of invariants are satisfied
by the public methods (e.g., that incr(N) is the same as incr() N times).  They
also serve to verify some of the compile-time feature-test logic which, if incorrect can
lead to mysterious errors (e.g., is it necessary to <c>#include <smmintrin.h></c>).
Unit tests include:

<ul>
<li> ut_features - verifies compile-time feature-test logic.
<li> ut_carray - verifies the capabilities of the @ref arrayNxW "r123arrayNxW" types.
<li> ut_M128 - verifies the capabilities of the r123m128i type (only when SSE2 is available).
<li> ut_ReinterpretCtr - verifies the r123::ReinterpretCtr wrapper template.
<li> ut_Engine - verifies the capabilities of the r123::Engine wrapper template.
<li> ut_aes - verifies that the @ref AESNI "AESNI" cbrngs match known answers from FIPS-197.
<li> ut_gsl - tests the @ref GSL_CBRNG adapter <b>Requires the GNU Scientific Library</b>.
</ul>

@section timers Measuring performance

We include some timing harnesses that can be used to measure
the performance of these CBRNGs on various platforms. They report aggregate throughput
in GB/sec:  a direct
measure of performance, but one that depends on clock speed
and number of cores being used.  They also report cpB (cycles-per-byte)
if they are invoked with an environment variable.  For example, 
<pre>
<code>
   env TIME_SERIAL_CPU_GHZ=3.2 ./time_serial
</code>
</pre>
will report cpB assuming a 3.2GHz clock.

<ul>
<li> time_serial - uses the C API and reports performance for a
single core.
<li> timers - uses the C++ API, and is the only tool that reports
AESNI1xm128i and ARS1xm128i performance (if your CPU supports the AES-NI instruction
extensions).
<li> time_thread - uses the C API and pthreads to report
multithreaded performance.  Uses TIME_THREAD_NTHREADS (or 12 if unset) threads.
<li> time_cuda - uses the C API within NVIDIA CUDA to run on NVIDIA GPUs.
<li> time_opencl - uses the C API within OpenCL to run on GPUs or CPUs.
</ul>

time_serial, time_thread, time_cuda, time_opencl all use a common 
kernel defined in time_random123.h.  They all use various 
util_* header files for utility functions and platform-related
boilerplate (also used by the pi_* examples).
