Crossover ratios

The crossover ratio (CR) determines what percentage of parameters in the
target vector are updated with difference vector selected from the
population.  In traditional differential evolution a CR value is chosen
somewhere in [0, 1] at the start of the search and stays constant throughout.
DREAM extends this by allowing multiple CRs at the same time with different
probabilities.  Adaptive crossover adjusts the relative weights of the CRs
based on the average distance of the steps taken when that CR was used.  This
distance will be zero for unsuccessful metropolis steps, and so the relative
weights on those CRs which generate many unsuccessful steps will be reduced.

Usage
-----

1. Traditional differential evolution::

    crossover = Crossover(CR=CR)

2. Weighted crossover ratios::

    crossover = Crossover(CR=[CR1, CR2, ...], weight=[weight1, weight2, ...])

The weights are normalized to one, and default to equally weighted CRs.

3. Adaptive weighted crossover ratios::

    crossover = AdaptiveCrossover(N)

The CRs are set to *[1/N, 2/N, ... 1]*, and start out equally weighted.  The
weights are adapted during burn-in (10% of the runs) and fixed for the
remainder of the analysis.

Compatibility Notes
-------------------

For *Extra.pCR == 'Update'* in the matlab interface use::

    CR = AdaptiveCrossover(Ncr=MCMCPar.nCR)

For *Extra.pCR != 'Update'* in the matlab interface use::

    CR = Crossover(CR=[1./Ncr], pCR=[1])
