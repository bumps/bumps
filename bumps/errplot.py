"""
Estimate model uncertainty from random sample.

MCMC uncertainty analysis gives the uncertainty on the model parameters
rather than the model itself.  For example, when fitting a line to a set
of data, the uncertainty on the slope and the intercept does not directly
give you the uncertainty in the expected value of *y* for a given value
of *x*.

The routines in bumps.errplot allow you to generate confidence intervals
on  the model using a random sample of MCMC parameters.  After calculating
the model *y* values for each sample, one can generate 68% and 95% contours
for a set of sampling points *x*.  This can apply even to models which
are not directly measured.  For example, in scattering inverse problems
the scattered intensity is the value measured, but the fitting parameters
describe the real space model that is being probed.  It is the uncertainty
in the real space model that is of primary interest.

Since bumps knows only the probability of seeing the measured value given
the input parameters, it is up to the model itself to calculate and display
the confidence intervals on the model and the expected values for the data
points.  This is done using the :mod:`bumps.plugin` architecture, so
application writers can provide the appropriate functions for their data
types.  Eventually this capability will move to the model definition so
that different types of models can be processed in the same fit.

For a completed MCMC run, four steps are required:

#. reload the fitting problem and the MCMC state
#. select a set of sample points
#. evaluate model confidence intervals from sample points
#. show model confidence intervals

:func:`reload_errors` performs steps 1, 2 and 3, returning *errs*.
If the fitting problem and the MCMC state are already loaded, then use
:func:`calc_errors_from_state` to perform steps 2 and 3, returning *errs*.
If alternative sampling is desired, then use :func:`calc_errors` on a
given set of points to perform step 3, returning *errs*.  Once *errs* has
been calculated and returned by one of these methods, call
:func:`show_errors` to perform step 4.
