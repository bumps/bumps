    Parse a multi-part file.

    Return a list of (header, data) pairs, where header is a key: value
    dictionary and data is a numpy array.

    The header section is list of key value pairs, with the *comment* character
    at the start of each line.  Key and value will be separated by *keysep*,
    or by spaces if *keysep = None*.  The data section is a sequence of
    floating point numbers separated by *sep*, or by spaces if *sep* is None.
    inf and nan are parsed as inf and nan.  Comments at the end of the data
    line will be ignored.  Data points can be commented out by including
    a comment character at the start of the data line, assuming the next
    character is a digit, plus, or decimal separator.

    Quotes around keys are removed, but not around values.  Use
    :func:`strip_quotes` to remove them if they are present.  This is different
    from the :func:`parse_file` interface, which strips quotes around values.
    The new interface allows *json.loads()* calls on values if values are
    stored as *key: json.dumps(value)*.

    Special hack for binned data: if the first column contains bin edges, then
    the last row will only have the bin edge.  To make the array square,
    we replace the bin edges with bin centers.  The original bins can be
    found in the header using the 'bins' key (unless that key already exists
    in the header, in which case the key will be ignored).
