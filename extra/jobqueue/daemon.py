Disk And Execution MONitor (Daemon)

daemonize()
  Detach the current process from the calling terminal so it can
  run as a service.
startstop()
  Check the first argument to the program.

     ========  ======
     argument  action
     ========  ======
     start     start the daemon
     stop      stop the daemon
     restart   stop the daemon if running, then start it again
     status    display running status
     run       run but not in daemon mode
     ========  ======

Configurable daemon behaviors:

1. The current working directory set to the "/" directory.
2. The current file creation mode mask set to 0.
3. Close all open files (1024).
4. Redirect standard I/O streams to "/dev/null".

Almost none of this is necessary (or advisable) if your daemon
is being started by inetd. In that case, stdin, stdout and stderr are
all set up for you to refer to the network connection, and the fork()s
and session manipulation should not be done (to avoid confusing inetd).
Only the chdir() and umask() steps remain as useful.

# TODO: generalize for windows and os x
#
# Need to extend daemon to handle Windows and OS X.
#
# startstop should be renamed control
# control should take additional commands for install/remove, presumably
# by querying the filename of the caller, assuming we can track that.
#
# Should support control from xinetd as well as init.d.  The run command
# may do so already.
#
# Mac OS 10.4 and above uses launchd.  The service will need an info.plist
# to describe the interactions and the script to run.
#
# Windows services can be created and manipulated from python, as shown in::
#    http://essiene.blogspot.com/2005/04/python-windows-services.html
#    http://code.activestate.com/recipes/59872/
#    http://code.activestate.com/recipes/551780/
#
# Need to isolate other system dependencies such as /var/log and /var/run
# so the caller doesn't care where the system normally puts the services.
# Should be able to run the service as a user, so first try putting files
# in the traditional place, and if that doesn't work, put them in ~/.service
